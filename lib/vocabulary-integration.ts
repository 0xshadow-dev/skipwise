/**
 * Vocabulary Integration System for SkipWise
 *
 * NOTE: This file is currently disabled due to TypeScript compatibility issues.
 * The main fuzzy system now uses super-fuzzy-categorizer.ts instead.
 *
 * This module provided intelligent vocabulary matching and categorization
 * by combining multiple data sources and fuzzy matching techniques.
 *
 * The functionality has been moved to super-fuzzy-categorizer.ts which
 * integrates directly with regional-data.ts for comprehensive vocabulary.
